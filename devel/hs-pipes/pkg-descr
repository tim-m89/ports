`pipes` is a clean and powerful stream processing library that lets you
build and connect reusable streaming components Advantages over traditional
streaming libraries: * /Concise API/: Use simple commands like 'for',
('>->'), 'await', and 'yield' * /Blazing fast/: Implementation tuned for
speed * /Lightweight Dependency/: @pipes@ is small and compiles very
rapidly, including dependencies * /Elegant semantics/: Use practical
category theory * /ListT/: Correct implementation of 'ListT' that
interconverts with pipes * /Bidirectionality/: Implement duplex channels
* /Extensive Documentation/: Second to none! Import "Pipes" to use the
library. Read "Pipes.Tutorial" for an extensive tutorial.
