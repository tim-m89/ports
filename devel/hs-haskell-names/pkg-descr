haskell-names does name and module resolution for haskell-src-exts AST.
Namely, it can do the following:

 * for a module, compute its interface, i.e. the set of entities exported by
   the module, together with their original names.
 * for each name in the module, figure out what it refers to â€” whether it's
   bound locally (say, by a where clause) or globally (and then give its
   origin).
