This is a generic programming library in the spirit of "Scrap your
boilerplate with class", but with several improvements -- most notably,
it's based on the gtraverse function instead of gfoldl.  gtraverse is
equivalent in power to gfoldl, but lets you more easily write
non-standard views of the data type.
