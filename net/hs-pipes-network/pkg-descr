Use network sockets together with the @pipes@ library. This package is
organized using the following namespaces: * "Pipes.Network.TCP" exports
pipes and utilities for using TCP connections in a streaming fashion. *
"Pipes.Network.TCP.Safe" subsumes "Pipes.Network.TCP", exporting pipes
and functions that allow you to safely establish new TCP connections within
a pipeline using the @pipes-safe@ facilities. You only need to use this
module if you want to safely acquire and release operating system resources
within a pipeline. See the @NEWS@ file in the source distribution to learn
about any important changes between version.
